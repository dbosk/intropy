# Existing learning outcomes

The students should be able to

  - use programming to solve problems,
  - apply the problem solving methodology also within other fields than 
    programming,
  - assess existing programs.

To be able to do this the students must learn to

  Lo01: design programs without code repetitions,
  Lo02: divide a larger problem in manageable parts,
  Lo03: divide a program
  Lo04: apply control structures
  Lo05: design and present user friendly output
  Lo06: create flexible applications
  Lo07: choose appropriate names of identifiers
  Lo08: design interactive programs
  Lo09: use and design composite data types (classes)
  Lo10: transfer data between file and program,
  Lo11: review others' programs.


# Revised learning outcomes

The students should be able to

  - [algorithmic thinking] divide a problem into suitable sub-problems [Lo02], 
    reassemble the solutions to the sub-problems into a solution for the 
    original problem;

    - thread of execution
    - distinguish sub-problems/minimize redundancy (discover suitable 
      functions):
      - determine prerequisites (suitable parameters/arguments) and results 
        ("return values").
      - distinguish iterations and recursion
      - distinguish data structures

  - [programming language] write functions that solves the sub-problems and 
    compose them into a function that solves the original problem 
    [Lo{01,03,06}, implicitly Lo{04,09,10}];

    - variables
    - functions
      - thread of execution
      - scope: arguments and return values
      - order of arguments
      - order of return values (tuples)
    - iterations: recursion, for, while
      - when to use recursion,
      - when to use for,
      - when to use while.
    - containers
    - classes
    - files

  - [usability] design usable text-based interfaces [Lo{05,08}];

    - usable output
    - usable input

  - [usability] write source code readable for humans [Lo07];

    - good identifier names
    - divide program into functions
    - PEP8

  - [evaluation] review source code written by others [Lo11].
