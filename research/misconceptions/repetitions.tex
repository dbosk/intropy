Loop construction is an algorithm that is hard to trace and understand for 
novice students, for instance when a loop starts, ends and what is repeated and 
not repeated in the loop (Sekiya \& Yamaguchi, 2013; Veerasamy et al., 2016; 
Kaczmarczyk et al., 2010) . This was something \textcite{Sleeman1984} also 
realized in their article \emph{Pascal and High-School Students: A Study of 
Misconceptions} when studying high school students writing and debugging 
loop-structures. One of the common misconception that the students had was that 
if the loop contained a print-statement, the students thought that the only 
thing that was repeated inside the loop was the string they saw in the 
terminal. The difficulties students have in tracing the code lineary when 
entering a loop is because of the lack of understanding the students have of 
the looping technique and the amount of cognitive skills the tracing takes 
(Veerasamy et al., 2016). 

Another difficult part of the loop technique is to understand how an if-statement inside a loop is executed. Sekiya \& Yamaguchi (2013) found in their studies \emph{Tracing quiz set to identify novices' programming misconceptions} that the combination of the two made the way for several student misconceptions. For instance the students thought that the variables in the conditional part of the loop-construction was control variables or the output from the loop. The students in the studies often got confused and started to misplace the different variables that are defined when writing an if-statement in a for-loop.
