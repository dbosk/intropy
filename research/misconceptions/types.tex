\subsection{Data types}

\subsubsection{Role in the syllabus}

In this chapter I was thinking that we could combine lists, arrays, maybe dictionaries, strings, charachters and the comparison of different type of variables. Maybe I will found another type that can be included here.

Doesnt understand how lists and arrays work: Veerasamy et al., 2016 Quote \emph{According to DCI, reference to arrays versus array elements, identifying off-by-one index errors, which occur when a student using less than or equal to where is less than, and declaring and manipulating arrays as important and difficult topic for students (Goldman et al., 2008). Notably, Boulay (1986) identified that students had misconceptions with array subscripts and dimensions. We also had similar results with students confused about lists and list indices. Moreover, 13\% of the students used negative numbers as indices to read or display the values from lists.}
