\section{Introduction}


In higher education in technology there often exists introductory 
programming courses, which is often referenced as \emph{Computer Science 1} 
(CS1). When students are introduced to the world of programming some
misconceptions, where students understand some critical aspects but 
misunderstand others \parencite{NCOL}, are bound to happen. These kind of 
misconceptions are something we have seen when educating students in CS1. 
These obstacles that students meet when first learning to code made us 
interested in mapping which misconceptions that are common and understand 
the origin of these misconceptions. To map these misconceptions we rely on 
earlier studies that have been done in the area, combined with our own 
findings. With the help of this knowledge we hope to get a better 
understanding of how one  could develop the courses in introductory 
programming to avoid these  misconceptions. In order to develop the course 
we are using variation theory, which we believe can be an effective tool in 
education. 

According to variation theory \parencite[Ch.~2]{NCOL}, each educational 
objective can be divided into different \emph{aspects}.
Consider the educational objective \enquote{the student should be able to 
use 
functions}.
One aspect of this particular educational objective is the local and global 
scope 
of variables.
Another aspect is returning values from a function.
For a student to achieve the educational objective, she must be able to 
discern 
the different aspects of the educational objective.
Aspects that the student hasn't yet discerned are critical aspects.
One necessary condition for learning is that the student is introduced to a 
series of patterns of variation in the dimension of each critical aspect.
Misconceptions are examples of when a student has failed to discern (at 
least) 
one critical aspect.
This allows us to use misconceptions to inform our designs when designing 
teaching according to variation theory.

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this study is to answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What misconceptions in introductory programming has been identified 
by 
    earlier research?
  \item Based on these misconceptions, what aspects (in terms of variation 
    theory) of introductory programming can we identify?
  \item What patterns of variation can be used to discern these aspects, to 
    teach them to students effectively?
  \item Where do we need further research?
\end{enumerate}
