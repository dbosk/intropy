\subsection{Conditionals}

A common control structure taught in CS1 is if- and else-statements, where the students learn how to create easy conditionals that controls the progress of the programme. How a programme will understand and execute an if-statement is something that students have misconceptions about. A severe misconception that \textcite{Plass2015Variables} found was that some students believe that an if-statement can control if the programme will keep on executing or shut down, depending on if the statement is true or false. Students believe that an if-statement that is false will terminate the programme, even though a quit-statement has not been introduced. Another misconception is that when writing an if and else statement, both if and else will be executed, even when the if-statement is true \parencite{MisconceptionsSurvey2017}.

XXX Add analysis on how we can teach conditionals in a way which help the students to understand when and how the code below the conditionals will be executed.


\textbf{Fun things to add:}

- "Incorrectly chaining conditions, like ‘if x != a or b’ which reads naturally in English as “if x is not equal to a or b.” We also saw cases like ‘if x > min and < max’ which reads as “if x is greater than min and less than max.”" - \parencite{GuoMarkelZhang2020}
