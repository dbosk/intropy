\subsection{Conditionals}

If-statements: If an if-statement is false the program will shut down, if true the program will keep on executing. Plass-Oude Bos, 2015. Also mentioned by Qian \& Lehman \emph{Conditionals are another difficult concept that leads to misconceptions (Green 1977; Sirkia 2012). Some students believe statements in both if and else blocks of a conditional expression will be executed (Sirkia 2012; Sleeman et al. 1986). Some students even mistakenly think that if the condition of an if-statement is false, the execution of the whole program stops (Sleeman et al. 1986)}
