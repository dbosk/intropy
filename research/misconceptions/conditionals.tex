How a programme will understand and execute an if-statement is something that students might have misconcepted. A severe misconception that \textcite{Plass2015Variables} found was that some students belive that an if-statement can control if the programme will keep on executing or shut down, depending on if the statement is true or false. Another misconception is that when writing an if and else statement both if and else will execute, even when the if-statement is true \parencite{MisconceptionsSurvey2017}
