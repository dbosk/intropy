IDE: What IDE is best for CS1? What difficulties can occure when using different IDEs? Should we recommend one? Quote from Qian \& Lehman \emph{Although many other syntactic-level errors are reported in previous research (see Altadmri and Brown (2015), Hristova et al. (2003), and Sorva (2012)), we do not discuss them in depth here, because problems in syntactic knowledge are often easy to detect and fix. Perhaps that is why they are often noted as the most frequent mistakes novices make (Altadmri and Brown 2015; Jackson et al. 2005). A compiler or a modern integrated development environment (IDE) may be able to find them and then provide error messages or hints for correction.}
