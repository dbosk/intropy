\section{Theoretical background}


\subsection{Variation Theory}

Here I'm thinking we should describe what variation theory is so that we can use it in the analysis later on.

\subsection{Misconceptions}

Do we need to describe what we mean with misconception? Do we maybe want to use another word?

\section{Misconceptions in introductory programming}
\label{misconceptions}

This section is divided to reflect the different concepts that are teached during CS1. Each section will describe what students often are meant to learn and understand in that module, which is then followed with a summary of what different studies have found is difficult for students in that module and which common misconceptions that students have. Each common misconception and/or difficulty will be analysed through the lens of variation theory, with the purpose of explaining how it can be avoided just by adjusting the way the specific term or concept is being introduced or taught.
