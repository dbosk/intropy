\section{Theoretical background}

\subsection{Misconceptions}

"discerned some critical aspects but not others" \parencite{NCOL}

"Sorva (2013) defined misconceptions as “understandings that are deficient or inadequate for many practical programming contexts” (p. 8:5) including syntax errors, misunderstandings of concepts and control flow, challenges about using learned constructs, difficulties in planning and debugging programs, and so forth" \parencite{MisconceptionsSurvey2017}

"Misconceptions, per se, are probably best defined as errors in conceptual understanding [...]" \parencite{MisconceptionsSurvey2017}

"A misconception is an erroneous belief, which is not true or valid." \parencite{KumarVeerasamy2016}

\subsection{Variation Theory}

Here I'm thinking we should describe what variation theory is so that we can use it in the analysis later on.

\section{Misconceptions in introductory programming}
\label{misconceptions}

This section is divided to reflect the different concepts that are teached during CS1. Each section will describe what students often are meant to learn and understand in that module, which is then followed with a summary of what different studies have found is difficult for students in that module and which common misconceptions that students have. Each common misconception and/or difficulty will be analysed through the lens of variation theory, with the purpose of explaining how it can be avoided just by adjusting the way the specific term or concept is being introduced or taught. 

\textbf{Fun things I do not know where to mention:}

- "Compiled languages allow code to call a function (or class) that is defined syntactically lower down in the source file, but in Python everything must be defined before being used." \parencite{GuoMarkelZhang2020}
