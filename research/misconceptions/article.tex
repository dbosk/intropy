\section{Misconceptions I have noticed that is not mentioned}

\begin{itemize}
    \item When returning a value from a function, students misses to 
capture it into a variable, not understanding why they cannot use the 
returned value later in the programme. 
    \item A local list in a function will be changed when passed to a 
function and then changed in that function. This because it is a 
reference to the list that is sent to the new function, not a copy of 
the list. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Random stuff removed from the article}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is also a misconception that variables can hold more than 
one value at a time \parencite{Doukakis2007}. This misconception can 
relate to several things:
    \begin{enumerate*}
      \item the type system, confusing lists with non-container types, not 
    seeing a 
        list as a type itself;
      \item the scope of variables, that the same variable identifier can be 
    used 
        for different things in different scopes.
    \end{enumerate*}

    \item Students that know that a return-statement is needed have 
difficulties returning the right value or variable from a function 
\parencite{KumarVeerasamy2016}. 

\end{itemize}
