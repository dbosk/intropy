\section{Misconceptions in introductory programming}
\label{misconceptions}

This section is divided to reflect the different concepts that are taught 
during CS1. Each section will describe what students often are meant to 
learn and understand in that module, which is then followed with a summary 
of what different studies have found is difficult for students in that 
module and which common misconceptions that students have. Each common 
misconception will be analysed through the lens of variation theory, with 
the purpose of explaining how it can be avoided just by adjusting the way 
the specific term or concept is being introduced or taught.

\section{Misconceptions not yet included}

\subsection{Random stuff removed from the article}

There is also a misconception that variables can hold more than one value 
at a time \parencite{Doukakis2007}.
This misconception can relate to several things:
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item the type system, confusing lists with non-container types, not 
seeing a 
    list as a type itself;
  \item the scope of variables, that the same variable identifier can be 
used 
    for different things in different scopes.
\end{enumerate*}

XXX Possible ways to attack this using variation theory \dots
