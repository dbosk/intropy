\section{Misconceptions in introductory programming}
\label{misconceptions}

This section is divided to reflect the different concepts that are taught 
throughout CS1. Each section will describe what students often are meant to 
learn and understand in that module. Something which is followed by a 
summary 
of what different studies have found is difficult for students in that 
particular
module and which common misconceptions that students may have. Each common 
misconception will be analysed through the lens of variation theory, with 
the purpose of explaining how it can be avoided by adjusting the way 
the specific term or concept is being introduced or taught.

\section{Misconceptions I have noticed that is not mentioned}

\begin{itemize}
    \item When returning a value from a function, students misses to 
capture it into a variable, not understanding why they cannot use the 
returned value later in the programme. 
    \item A local list in a function will be changed when passed to a 
function and then changed in that function. This because it is a 
reference to the list that is sent to the new function, not a copy of 
the list. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Random stuff removed from the article}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is also a misconception that variables can hold more than 
one value at a time \parencite{Doukakis2007}. This misconception can 
relate to several things:
    \begin{enumerate*}
      \item the type system, confusing lists with non-container types, not 
    seeing a 
        list as a type itself;
      \item the scope of variables, that the same variable identifier can be 
    used 
        for different things in different scopes.
    \end{enumerate*}

    \item Students that know that a return-statement is needed have 
difficulties returning the right value or variable from a function 
\parencite{KumarVeerasamy2016}. 

\end{itemize}
