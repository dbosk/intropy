\section{Introduction}

We study misconceptions in introductory programming from the perspective of 
variation theory.
We first survey the existing literature on misconceptions in introductory 
programming.
We then analyze these misconceptions using variation theory.

According to variation theory \parencite[Ch.~2]{NCOL}, each educational 
objective can be divided into different \emph{aspects}.
Consider the educational objective \enquote{the student should be able to use 
functions}.
One aspect of this particular educational objective is local and global scope 
of variables.
Another aspect is returning values from a function.
For a student to achieve the educational objective, she must be able to discern 
the different aspects of the educational objective.
Aspects that the student hasn't yet discerned are critical aspects.
One necessary condition for learning is that the student is introduced to a 
series of patterns of variation in the dimension of each critical aspect.
Misconceptions are examples of when a student has failed to discern (at least) 
one critical aspect.
This allows us to use misconceptions to inform our designs when designing 
teaching according to variation theory.

This study answers the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What misconceptions in introductory programming has been identifies in 
    the literature?
  \item Based on these misconceptions, what aspects (in terms of variation 
    theory) of introductory programming can we identify?
  \item Where do we need further research?
\end{enumerate}


\section{Prerequisites: definitions}

Added this to explain different words we use in the text and how we interpreted them and use them. Maybe we dont need subsections for every word, but I started this way.

Maybe it will be needed, maybe not. Uncertain at the moment.

\subsection{Variation Theory}

Here I'm thinking we should describe what variation theory is so that we can use it in the analysis later on.

\subsection{Misconception}

Do we need to describe what we mean with misconception? Do we maybe want to use another word? 

\subsection{Computational thinking}

Maybe we want to include something about computational thinking in this article? 

\subsection{Conceptual Change Theory}

An interesting method to unlearn misconceptions and instead learn the correct conception. Mentioned by Qian \& Lehman. 


\section{Surveying the literature on misconceptions}

I'm thinking we need a method-section to describe how this research has been 
conducted. Something about the literature collecting and so on. 

Indeed, you'll need to describe the search queries and the selection criteria.


\section{Important modules in CS1}

This section is divided to reflect the different concepts that are teached during CS1. Each section will describe what students often are meant to learn and understand in that module, which is then followed with a summary of what different studies have found is difficult for students in that module. XXX And then we also will try to analyze the findings with the help of variation theory.

\input{classes.tex}
\input{repetitions.tex}
\input{types.tex}
\input{conditionals.tex}
\input{problem-solving.tex}
\input{tools.tex}

\section{Analysis}

The analyze will be performed with the help of variation theory. 

\section{Discussion}

Here we can discuss what we want to analyze and research further. We might also want to discuss how to design the education to avoid everything above.
