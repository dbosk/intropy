\section{Introduction}

Introduce and give som background on the subject and why we have chosen to analyze this. 

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this article is to give an overview of the studies that has been conducted on this subject and analyze these with help of variation theory to understand how one is supposed to teach CS1 to help students grasp important concepts in learning programming. Another purpose with this article is to discuss what further studies we need to conduct to understand deeper what students difficulties there are and how the education can be designed to avoid these. 

\section{Method}

I'm thinking we need a method-section to describe how this research has been conducted. Something about the litterature collecting and so on. 

\section{Concepts}

Added this to explain different words we use in the text and how we interpreted them and use them. Maybe we dont need subsections for every word, but I started this way.

\subsection{Variation Theory}

Here I'm thinking we should describe what variation theory is so that we can use it in the analysis later on.

\subsection{Misconception}

\subsection{Conceptual knowledge}

\section{Important modules in teaching CS1}

This section is divided to reflect the different concepts that are teached during CS1. Each section will describe what students often are meant to learn and understand in that module, which is then followed with a summary of what different studies have found is difficult for students in that module. 

\subsection{Functions and variables}

\subsubsection{Role in the syllabus}

Do we want to have an introduction in every module to describe what the students are meant to learn when teaching CS1? Would be nice with som introduction, but maybe without a subsubsection, and only with one or two sentences. 

Example: Functions and variables are typically learned at the same time because they go hand in hand etc....

\subsubsection{Difficulties that can occure}

According to Yizhou Qian and James Lehman (2017) in their article \emph{Studentsâ€™ Misconceptions and Other Difficulties in Introductory Programming: A Literature Review} students have difficulties understanding how variables and that the students usually make assumptions about variables that are wrong. For example one assumption is that variables can hold more then one value at the time. According to other studies sometimes students even think that variables can hold an entire algorithm and therefor see a variable as a function or equation. This will create problems when a student creates a variable in belief that the variable will change its value when the equation is supposed to change its value or at the time when the variable is used in the program (Kohn, 2017; Plass-Oude Bos, 2015). Kohn (2017) explains that this misconseption can be connected to how variable definitions are used in math. 

But it is not only the right side of the variable definition that students can have misconceptions about. The name of the variable has been misunderstood as having power of the value which it holds (Qian \& Lehman, 2017; Sleeman et al., 1984). For example if a student names one variable \emph{max} and another variable \emph{min}, the student might think that the variables will strictly only hold the maximum value and the minimum value througout the program. 

If we move on to the relationship between variables and functions we can see more conceptual misconseptions that students have. The first difficulty is how students treat return-values. When a function is supposed to return a value some students miss the return value, expecting the function to return it by default (Kurvinen et al., 2016; Kumar Veerasamy et al., 2016). A student might also write a function which returns a value, but that value is not stored or being used later in the program (Altadmri \& Brown, 2015). Some students might also believe that a print-statement at the end of a function will act as a return statement (Qian \& Lehman, 2017). Another misconception that goes hand in hand with the assumption that a variable holds an equation and not a single value, is that if in the return statement the student returns an equation, the student believes that the return value will be that equation, not the value that the equation represents (Kohn, 2017). Some students also have difficulties returning the right value or variable from a function (Kumar Veerasamy et al., 2016). 

It is not only the return value that is difficult to grasp for students, the input arguments are also a difficult concept for some students. When calling a function it shows that the student have trouble using and understanding what arguments are meant to be used in the function call (Altadmri \& Brown, 2015). Ann E. Fleury (1991) researched the conceptual misconseptions students have when using parameters in functions, in her article \emph{Parameter passing: the rules the students construct}. What she found was that students had constructed their own rules for the using of global and local variables which were connected to the using of variables in functions. The first rule that a student had conducted was that when changing a local variable in a function, the variable was changed for the whole program. Another assumption made by the students was that if the local variable was not an argument in the function-call, the program would go back to where the function was called and search for it there. The assumptions the students had made about global variables was that if a function references to a global variable, it will create an error in the program because the global variable was not an argument in the function call. The students also believed that if a global variable was changed in the function body, the new value would not be reachable for the rest of the program if not returned by the function (Fleury, 1991).

The difference between variables in programming and variables in math is differences that some students does not grasp. If a student in a variable definition uses on the right side of the equal symbol a variable that is not defined, but the variable on the left side is already defined, they think that the computer will solve this as an equation (Plass-Oude Bos, 2015). This assumption by the students is also something discovered by Kohn (2017) when giving the students the definition \emph{x = x + 1}. If you look at this definition with a mathematical perspective you will see an unsolvable equation, which is also what some of the students saw. They did not see that the x to the left is the variable, and that the x to the right only holds a value. This definition is  easier to understand for a novice programmer according to Kohn (2017) when we instead write this definition as \emph{x += 1}. 


\subsection{Data types}

\subsubsection{Role in the syllabus}

In this chapter I was thinking that we could combine lists, arrays, maybe dictionaries, strings, charachters and the comparison of different type of variables. Maybe I will found another type that can be included here.

Variables in if-statements that are in for-loops: Tracing quiz set to identify novices' programming misconceptions av Takayuki Sekiya, Kazunori Yamaguchi, Yizhou Qian and James Lehman (2017)

Understanding how to trace the execution-steps in a for loop: Veerasamy et al., 2016

Misconception about what is repeated in a loop, quote from Qian \& Lehman (originally from Sleeman et al 1984): \emph{ For example, if there are several lines inside a loop, and one of them is an output statement such as a print statement, students may think only the print statement is repeated by the loop because they only see the repeated output on the screen.}

\subsection{Problemsolving}

Here I want to have some articles about how math-problems will make it harder for students to solve the problem. Quote from Veerasamy et al \emph{This study analysis also explored that novices of programming struggled in writing code for math-related Questions 6 and 7 (refer Table C1). Nearly 66\% of students did not do well in the mathematical problem-based questions though explained and allowed to surf the Internet to seek for more details during the exam hours. A neo-Piagetian theory of cognitive development stated that students who are at the concrete operational stage struggle to write large programs with partial specifications, although they can write small programs from well-defined specifications (Teague et al., 2012).}

Also I would want to include difficulties students have when debugging the code and trying to find errors. Students often have a problem with tracing the code, something that is discussed in page 20 by Sleeman et al., 1984. 

Would also maybe like to mention how a lab instruction should be to help students get the right knowledge from the lab. Is discussed somewhere in Yizhou Qian and James Lehmans article I think.

\subsection{Things that doesnt fit in anywhere else..}

In what order a program will be executed in: Programming misconceptions in an introductory level programming course exam by Einari Kurvinen, Niko Hellgren, Erkki Kaila, Mikko-Jussi Laakso, Tapio Salakoski

If-statements: If an if-statement is false the program will shut down, if true the program will keep on executing. Plass-Oude Bos, 2015. Also mentioned by Qian \& Lehman \emph{Conditionals are another difficult concept that leads to misconceptions (Green 1977; Sirkia 2012). Some students believe statements in both if and else blocks of a conditional expression will be executed (Sirkia 2012; Sleeman et al. 1986). Some students even mistakenly think that if the condition of an if-statement is false, the execution of the whole program stops (Sleeman et al. 1986)}

IDE: What IDE is best for CS1? What difficulties can occure when using different IDEs? Should we recommend one? Quote from Qian \& Lehman \emph{Although many other syntactic-level errors are reported in previous research (see Altadmri and Brown (2015), Hristova et al. (2003), and Sorva (2012)), we do not discuss them in depth here, because problems in syntactic knowledge are often easy to detect and fix. Perhaps that is why they are often noted as the most frequent mistakes novices make (Altadmri and Brown 2015; Jackson et al. 2005). A compiler or a modern integrated development environment (IDE) may be able to find them and then provide error messages or hints for correction.}


\section{Analysis}

The analyze will be performed with the help of variation theory. 

\section{Discussion}

Here we can discuss what we want to analyze and research further. We might also want to discuss how to design the education to avoid everything above.
